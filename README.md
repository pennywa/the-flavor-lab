## 🎯 What is The Flavor Lab?

Tired of the same old recipes? **The Flavor Lab is your culinary cheat code!** 

This groundbreaking, interactive application unlocks the hidden chemistry behind taste. Forget traditional pairing guides – we use the science of the **FlavorGraph network** to map common aromatic compounds, letting you input any ingredient (like Strawberry or Basil) and instantly receive shocking, yet scientifically perfect, flavor matches (like Goat Cheese or Black Olive).

It's the essential tool for chefs, mixologists, and ambitious home cooks who want to break boundaries, create signature dishes, and achieve culinary genius: all rooted in pure, delicious chemistry.

## 🚀 MVP Features

- **Input**: Type any ingredient
- **Output**: Get scientifically-backed flavor pairings and recipe suggestions
- **Interactive**: Pick ingredients to see flavor matches
- **Visual**: Graph-based ingredient relationships

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Data Processing
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)

### Data Storage
- **MongoDB** (NoSQL) - Flexible storage for ingredient relationships and flavor compound data

### Web Application
- **Streamlit** - Interactive web interface for input/output

## 📊 Data Source

**FlavorGraph**: https://github.com/lamypark/FlavorGraph
- Food + chemical compound network
- Build relationships between ingredients
- Visualize as a graph
- Scientific backing for flavor pairings

## 🎨 Project Philosophy

Our project needs to **SLAP**:
- **S**cientific - Rooted in real chemistry
- **L**ogical - Makes sense to users
- **A**mazing - Surprising flavor combinations
- **P**ractical - Actually useful in the kitchen

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- MongoDB

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/the-flavor-lab.git
cd the-flavor-lab

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
